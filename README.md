# Optimization Methods
Review and coding practice with classic approximation and optimization methods using python.


### Newton's Method
1. First-order approximation to find closest root, context must satisfy Intermediate Value Theorem.
   1. Works for f(x) and g(x) since both have solutions near initialization point x0.
2. Optimization method that involve second-order approximations of the objective function using 1st and 2nd derivaties for univariable problems, and gradient and Hessian for multivariable problems.
   1. Univariable problems: doesn't work for f(x) since it is a non-convex function, works for g(x) that is convex in interval [0,1].
